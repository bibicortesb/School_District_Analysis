# School_District_Analysis

## Project Overview

PyCity Schools are seeking have prepared and analysed a source of data. They expect to deliver the following:

1. Data collection.
2. Data preparation. 
3. Data Summary.
4. Drill down.
5. Comparisons Between District and Charter Schools. 

### Purpose

Through this project I assisted Maria to prepare a source of data for analysis, reporting, and presentation to provide insights about performance trends and patterns in the school districts. The analysis will focus on student funding and students' standardized test scores. The main purpose is to aggregate data and show trends in school performance.


## Resources

- Data Source: new_full_student_data.csv
- Software: Python 3.9.12, Visual Studio Code, 1.71.2


## Summary

Through this analysis, the following was observed:

- While preparing data for analysis, some null values and duplicates were dropped.
- Overall students perform better in reading than in math.
- An interesting finding was that reading has a similiar score for both schoool types. However, there is a significant difference for math scores, for Charter on average 66.76 while for public average score is 62.95.
- The school with most students is Montgomery High School.
- Public schools have more budget than Charter schools. However, the count of students is necessary to have a weighted average of budget, since Public schools may seem to have more budget but depending on the amount of students we could confirm that. I'll suggest that table for further budget analysis.
- Data is preapred for any further analysis Maria requieres for strategies based on school performance. If she wants to focus on a specific school, compare Charter vs Public, between grades. Using group by and loc functions, will enable Maria to present startegies based on data.
